# UAV-based Image Segmentation of Crop Lands into Crop/Weed Classes using Self-Constructed UNET
## (1) Image Segmentation

Image segmentation is a computer vision task that involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions based on certain criteria. 
The goal is to simplify or change the representation of an image into more meaningful and easier-to-analyze parts.Segmentation is valuable because 
it allows computers to understand and interpret images more effectively, facilitating various applications like object recognition, image editing, medical diagnosis, and more.
